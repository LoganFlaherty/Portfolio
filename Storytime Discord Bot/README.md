# Storytime Discord Bot
A discord bot for the purposes of TTRPG functionality such as rolling arbitrary dice, saving character stats, and rolling dice in conjunction with character stats. Made using DSharpPlus, a .Net wrapper for the Discord API. 

To startup the bot enter the bin/Debug folder and double-click Storytime Bot.exe. However, Token (found in config.json) and guildID (found in Bot.cs) are filled with placeholders for security. To properly utilize the bot go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in using your discord account. Next, select "New Application" and go through the required steps to create an applicatin. Next, select the "Installation" tab and select "Guild Install", add "applications.commands" and "bot" scopes, then generate the invite link using "Discord Provided Link". From here, click the link and invite the bot into a discord server you own. You can make a new server to test this. However, for the bot to be able to connect to the Discord API and execute command in the server, you must load the token and guildID where the placeholders are. Your application token can be found "Bot" tab of the Discord Dev site where you have to generate it by hitting "reset token" or "generate token". The guildID of a server can be found by right-clicking the server icon and selecting "Copy Server ID". After performing these steps, you now have a fully functional Storytime Bot!
