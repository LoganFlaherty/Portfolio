# Projects
A repo that acts as a library for all my computing projects.

Each project has a README within its directory that goes into more detail about it.

## Storytime Discord Bot
A Discord bot for Tabletop RPGs, enabling dice rolling, character stats tracking, and game mechanics using DSharpPlus, a .NET Discord API wrapper.

## Edge Trader
A work-in-progress arcadey stockmarket roguelike made in Godot Game Engine using its native GDScript, a language similar to Python.
