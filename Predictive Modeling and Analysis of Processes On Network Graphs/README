##Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Processes on Network Graphs in R
This project explores techniques for modeling and predicting processes on network graphs using R 4.3.3. It applies nearest-neighbor methods, Markov Random Fields (MRF), 
and kernel regression to a protein-protein interaction dataset (ppi.CC). The study also simulates dynamic processes such as the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) 
model on various network topologies. The results highlight significant improvements in prediction accuracy with advanced methods and demonstrate the important 
influence of topology on dynamic processes. Graphs generated via R are presented for clarity. Along with it comes a highly detailed paper delving into the technicals.
